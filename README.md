# Assassin's Creed: Odyssey Mods
Appearance/Outfit mods for Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, using Forger Utility Tool by hypermorphic from Nexusmods.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
1) [Forger 2.6.5 Utility tool](https://www.nexusmods.com/assassinscreedodyssey/mods/42?tab=files) by hypermorphic
2) Any .forger2 file(s) with the mods that you want

### Installation
1) Follow hypermorphic's [instructions to install Forger 2.6.5 Utility tool](https://www.nexusmods.com/assassinscreedodyssey/articles/5).
2) Drop any .forger2 file into your "ForgerPatches" folder, located inside your game folder (same location as your ACOdyssey.exe file).
3) Open Forger 2.6.5, hit "Rescan" if necessary. ï»¿New patches will be highlighted in yellow, and updates to existing patches will display in green.
4) Check "Invisible Abstergo Bow and Quiver", this shouldn't take long but wait until the check appears.
5) Close Forger. **If you leave Forger opened and start the game, your files may get corrupted and you will have to restore the game before reinstalling Forger.**
6) Open the game and play as usual.

### Troubleshooting
1) Try clicking "Reset All Forges" button in Forger and reapplying the mod.
2) If not, try "Reset All Forges" again. Then, verify the game files via UPlay and repair corrupted game files.
3) If this still doesn't work, follow the instructions for "restoring the game" in [Forger 2 User's Guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/assassinscreedodyssey/articles/5)
4) If all else fails, try uninstalling and reinstalling the game.
